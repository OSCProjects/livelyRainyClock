# THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES YOUR OWN LIVELYCU.EXE FILE, YOU CAN FIND IT [HERE](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively/releases/download/v2.0.4.0/lively_command_utility.zip)
# All you need to set it up is get your Longtitude and Latitude and set it in the settings.json and also give it your livelycu.exe path

### Lively brightness changer
I always forget to change the brightness for lively wallpaper, so i made it automatic, this python script changes the current time into seconds, and calculates the dusk and dawn times, a better settings manager coming not soon
This only works for automatically setting up a Livelyproperty from the wallpaper json file, it works with any wallpaper, you just need to change the Lively property in the settings.json file to match the Livelyproperty you want to change


It also looks cool i guess, it is mostly customisable, you can change this code to your liking and use it in your own projects
